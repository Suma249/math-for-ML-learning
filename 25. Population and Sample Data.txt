Population and Sample Data

Population: is the entire set of individuals or objects of interest in a particular study. it includes all members of a defined group
that we are studying or collecting information on

characteristcs include,
 1. complete set: it contains all the observations of interst
 2. parameter: a numerical value summaring the entire population(population mean, population variance are examples)
ex: 
 1. population in a school study: all students enrolled in a school
    usecase: determining average height of students(population mean)
 2. population in market reasearch: all the consumers in the city
    usecase: to understand the purchasing behaviour of all consumers
 3. population in a medical study: all the patients with a specific disease
    usecase: to study the effectiveness of a drug


Sample Data: is a subset of the populaton that is used represent the entire group. sampling invovles selecting a group of individuals or observations
  from the population to draw conclusions about the whole population

characteristics includes,
 1. subset: represents the portion of the population
 2. statistic: a numerical value summarizing the sample data (sample mean, sample variance)
 3. random sampling: samples should be randomly selected to avoid bias
ex: 
 1. sample in a school study: a group of 50 students
    usecase: estimate the average height of students in a school
 2. sample in market research: sample of 500 consumers in the city
    usecase: generakize population behavious based on sample cusyomers behaviour
 3. sample in a medical study: 400 patients
    usecase" test the effectiveness of a drug
