heights are recorded( 175cm, 180c, 140cm, 135cm, 160cm, 120cm]

over here
descriptive question: what is the average height of the entire class -> we use measure of central tendency here
infrentual question:are the height of samplew students in classrom similar to what u express in the entire colleg -> making a conclusion
