Scalar Multiplication
it involves multiplying a vector by scalar resukting in a vector where each component is scaled by the vector
a=[ 3 5 7] c=4 => ca=> [ 12 20 28] 

in cordinate system, if we represent a scalar the pointa=[2 2], multiplie dbythsi scalar c=2, will result in extendin this line from origin to thsi point to the other
point that is the ca

examples:
there is something called normalization and standardization
in normalization or standardization -> we will be scaling the data to some units, but why?
lets say we have a gray scale image of 4*4 pixels and every pixel will be raging betwen 0 to 255 representing colors
when we say gray scale there is only one channel
fot image processing, its good things that we normalize the pixel values into 0 and 1
how do we normalize it?
we will take evry pixel and divide it by 255 -> that will be conveted to 0 or 1 -> this is called normalization

lets say we have a feature called height and will cosnider that as a vector
and now lets say we want to convert or scale thsi height to meters, now to scale , we bascally take a scaling factor and will multiply height vector by scaling factor
