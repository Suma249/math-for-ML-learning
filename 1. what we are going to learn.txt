1. linear algebra
2. statistics -> basics to advanced -> applications of all the topivs in data science
3. differential calculus 

1. linear algebra: scalars, vector operations, matrices, matrix operations, functions, linear transformations, inverse function, eigen values and eigen vectors
 neural network: forward propogation -> matrix operations (application in data science)

2. statistics: ml, deep learning -> models -> huge datasets

3. differential calculus
