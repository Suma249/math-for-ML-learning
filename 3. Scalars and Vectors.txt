Scalars and Vectors  are used in physics, maths and computer science

Scalar:is a single numerical value and it represents a magnitude or quantity and has no directions
ex: car speed of 45 km/hr, value 45 is the magnitude
    temperature in celsius: 25 decree celsium
applications in data science
 lets say we have a dataset with features f1, f2 and f3 with 5 specific records
 if we calcukate the total number if records or average of the feature f1 -> scalar
 for a prolem regression, in simple limnear regression we use eq y=mx+c m =slope and c=ointerceot
 here we wont consider m as scalar value but c because c is a single numberical value but the value of m depends on x

Vectors: is a numerical value that has both magnitude amd direction
in data science, a bvector is a ordered list of numbers that can reprrsent a point in space or quantity with both magnitude and direction
ex: speed of the car is 45 km/hr in the direction of east
lets say we have a datet with features iq, number of study hours and whether the student has been oassed or failed 
here a vector reprsenting person iq and number of study hours [90,3hrs], 3 is the magnitude and hrs is the unit
lets say we have a vector reprrsenting person weights overs time [70, 72, 75, 73] -> for jan, feb, mnarch april
where doe durectons come into picture: in data science directions does not directly come into picture
in datsacience, vector represents a colection of values in different dimensions

in data science and machine learning, we create models, aim of this model is to take input feature and preduct the output feature which is a respinse of model
iq, numberOfHours pass/fail
90    2             fail
100   2             pass
each record can be represented as a vector,iq can be plotted against nu,ber of hours in the xy coordinate

unit vectror: has a magnitude of value 1
