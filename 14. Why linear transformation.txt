1. dimensionality reducetion
if our dataset has many features whivch is difficult to visualize at max as human we can only visualize 3 dimensions
so with dimensionality reducetion we will convert high dimension to low dimension by capturing the variance in the data
here it invovles transformation of data points

2. feature engineering: 

3. data preprocessing

4. neural networks
