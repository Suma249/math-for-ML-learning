matrix operations are fundamental to data science as they provide a mechanism to manipulate and analyse multidemensional data efficiently

when we datasets wrt to rows and columns, we can convert that nto matrix, considering this main operations on matrix that we speccifically do is
 1. matrix addition and subtraction
 2. scalar matrix multiplication
 3. matrix multiplication

1. Matrix addition and subtraction
   we add or subtract cooresponding elemnets of 2 matrces of the same dimension
   lets say we have datset of 3 different products sold of different days in store 1 and similar suc dataset fr store 2
   now to know the selling of each type of product in each store on different day we can use matrix addition
  

2. Scalar Multiplication: involves multiplying every element of matrix by a scalar value
 lets say, suppose we have a matrix representing product prices in dollars and we want to adjustthese prices for inflation by a factor of 1.05
 scalar multiplication => lets say we have price matrix p => padjusted => 105*p
 lets say we have a datset of base salry of software engineers, hrs and accountants
 45k   30k  40k => in company a
 50k   35k  45k => in company b

now in 2024, we wnatto update this data based on inflation  -> here it is scalar multiplication
specifically scalar multiplication is use din feature engineering

3. Matrix Multiplication: in most of ML na dDL algoruthms, matrix multiplication is used
 operation: it invovles the dot product of rows of first matrix with columns of the second matrix
  for two matrices a(m*n) and b(n*p) -> resultant of a*b => is c(m*p)
  number of columns in first matrix shoud be equal to the number of rows in second matrix
  lets consider
 a=[1 2 3]  b=[7 9 11]
   [4 5 6]    [8 10 12]
a is of dimension -> 2*3 and b is pf dimension -> 2*3, here condition is not emt for matrix multiplication'so in such scenarios we will do tanspose of b matrix 
where rows are cinverted into coumns so now transpose of b=>[7 8]
                                                            [10 9]                         
                                                            [11 12]
           [7 8]
a.b=[1 2 3][10 9]  => [c11 c12]
    [4 5 6][11 12]    [c21 c22]
dot product of each row with each each of the column
c11=> (1*7)+(2*!0)+3*11)=58
c12=>(1*8)+(2*10)+(3*!2) =64
and siilarly we get c21 and c22
this kind of operations are used in training deep learning neural networks and also in ML algorithms -> used extensively
