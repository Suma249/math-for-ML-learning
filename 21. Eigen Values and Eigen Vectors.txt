eigen values and eigen vectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that have numerous applications in various fields such as physics, cs and data scirnce
they provide insights into the properties of linear transformations represented by matrices.

eighen value represented by lambda is a scalar that indicates how much an eigen vector is basically stretched or compressed during linear transformation

eigen vector represented by v is a non zero vector that only changes in scale but not direction when a linear transformation is applied

for square matrix A, an eigen vector and its corresponding eigen value satisfy the equation AV=lambda V

let A=[4 1]
      [2 3]
to find eigen values 
   det(A-AI)=0 => [4 1][lambda 0]=[4-lambda 1]
                  [3 2][0 lambda] [2 3-lambda]
                (4-lambda)(3-lambda)-(2)(1)=0
                  lambda^2 - 7lambda + 10=0(quadratic equation format), solving this equation will get
                 lambda=5 and lambda=2 => eighen values of matrix A
finding eigen vectors
   (A-lambda*I)v=0
  lambda=5
      A-5I=[4 1]-[5 0]
           [2 3] [0 5]
          =[-1 1]
           [2 -2]
  [-1 1][x]
  [2 -2][y]=0 => y=x

 for lambda=2
      y=-2x
A=[4 1]
  [2 3] 
lambda1=5  => v1=[1 1](ex as x=y)
lambda2=2 => v2=[1 -2](ex as y=-2x)
