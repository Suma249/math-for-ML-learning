Vector magnitude is about vector length

unit vector: vector has a length of 1

how to calculate the vector length

les say we have  vector x(->) that belongs to real values of n dimension(R^n) lets say we have values [x1, x2, x3...]
lets say we have x vector that has values x=[2 3] and now if we go ahead and see with respect to coordinates 2 will be on x axis and 3 will be on y axis
if we join these 2 pointd on xy corrdinate will get (2 3) point, and now whn we say length of vector it is the lwngthfrom origin to this point
and this length can be calculated by using pythagorus theorem

lets say we have another vector A(->) that belongs to 3 dimensions(R^3) and ths can be represented as ||A||= sqyare root of (x1^2+x2^2+x3^2)
so for any n dimension, square root of(x1^2+x2^2+x3^2+...xn^2)

for the unit vector ||u||=1 also represented bu u cap

to convert any vector v t unt vector => (1/||v||)*v

lets say we have v=[ 1 2 0] belongs to real values of 3 dimensions 
unit vector can be calculated using the above formula

vector [2 3] can be reprsented as 2icap + 3jcap -> it will be useful in normalization technique
whateve may be the vector size, length of unit vector will be 1
