vector transformations

lets say we have a function f: X -> Y, domain X may have set of vevtors and domain Y may have a set of vectors
in this scenario, lets consider we have vector x in X and we want to tranform this x vector into y hat
lets say we have a real number space of n dimension represented by R^n, our aim is, lets say there is a vector x in this space
to transform this vector into another vector y that is in another real number space of n dimension
f: R^n -> R^n
x vector = [ x1 x2 x3...xn], where x1, x2..xn belongs to real number
lets say we want to have 
f(x, y,z)=(x+y, 2z)
f([ 1 2 3]) =[3, 6]

in xyz coordinate system, we can represent [1 2 3], if we project it, from top view we will get [ 1 2 3]
after applying the function we get point [3 6] in xy coordinate system

initially we had vector [1 2 3] that belongs to 3d real numbers that has been mapped to [3 6 ] tthat belongs to real numbers of 2d 
this proccess of mapping vectors from one to another vector is called transformations

hoe to project (1 2 3) and how we it is mapped to [3, 6] -> in coordinate system ?

why we perform vector transformations?
vector transformation: operation that maps vectors from one space to another, often changing their magnitude, direction or both. these transformations are 
typically described using metrics and are fundamental in various fields including physics, engineering, computer graphics amd data science

examples:
1. scaling: a transformation that changes the magnitude of vectors while keeping their direction same
if we have a vector v and we want to scale it using 2 -> than we get v1=2*v
why scaling is important: in data science scaling is used in data normalization and also used computer graphics to resize the image

2. rotation
transformation that turns vectors around the origin
lets say we have a vectir v=[1 0] that belonging to real numbers, here transformed vector would be [ 0 1] -> showing 90 degree rotation
it ia useful in deep learning image processing techniques
rotation will be used in image processing secifically
robotics: for adjusting robot orientation
3d graphics -> rotating objects

3. Reflection: transformation that flips vectors over a specified axis or plane
lets say we have vector v=[3 4] -> flippng across the yaxis will get eiher [-3 4] or [3 -4] it appens by multiplying the vector v with either [-1 1] or [1 -1]

4. mirroring images
5. shearing
