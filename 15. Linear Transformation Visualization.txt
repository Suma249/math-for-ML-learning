transformation takes a vector and converts it into another vector 

let transformation T:R -> R (1 dimension)
transformat that we want to apply is T(x)=2x, T(x)=(1/2)xs are all linear transformations

with linear transformation, origin must be fixed and all lines must remain as line
scale may chaneg but origin will remains ame
